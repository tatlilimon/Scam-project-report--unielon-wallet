As you can see, the person has published the application on github, but there is no file in the 'code' section. The product has only been published in the 'Releases' section. Therefore, I first opened such an repo to examine what changes were made in previous versions. As you can see, the developer of the project did not make any changes to the product. Just changed the names of certain variables to give the impression that a new version is out :)

It also reduced important files in the source code to inline format, but forgot or didn't care that it was easily editable with text editors.

Let's get to the important part. There is a `.wasm` ( [web assembly](https://webassembly.org/) ) file in the project. This file is compiled from the source code and translated into machine language and is quite difficult for humans to read. There is no documentation in the project showing from which source code this .wasm file was compiled. Therefore, the fate of the users' assets is in doubt. It is stated that after the project exits the beta stage, the tokens that minted by the users can be bought and sold. But this will not happen. Most likely in the .wasm file; A code is written that takes control of all assets that come after a certain stage and transfers them to certain wallets.

If you don't believe what I'm saying, you can download the versions one by one and compare them with each other and learn the truth.
